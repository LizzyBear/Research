Modeling emerging contaminants breakthrough in packed bed adsorption columns by UV absorbance and fluorescing components of dissolved organic matter,Sep 2018,"This study investigated, using rapid small-scale column testing, the breakthrough of dissolved or-ganic matter (DOM) and eleven emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) during granular activat-ed carbon (GAC) filtration of different water qualities, including wastewater, surface water and synthetic water (riverine organic matter dissolved in deionized water). Fluorescing organic matter was better adsorbed than UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in all tested water. Furthermore, highest adsorption of DOM (in terms of DOC, UV254 and fluorescence) was observed during wastewater filtration. UV absorbing DOM had fast and similar breakthrough in surface water and synthetic water, whereas fluorescence breakthrough was very rapid only in synthetic water. PARAFAC modeling showed that different fluorescing components were differently adsorbed during GAC process. Particularly, fluorescing compo-nents with maxima intensity at higher excitation wavelengths, which are corresponding to humic-like fluorescence substances, were better removed than other components in all waters. As op-posed to DOM, EOCs were better adsorbed during synthetic water filtration, whereas the fastest EOCs breakthrough was observed during filtration of wastewater, which was the water that de-termined the highest carbon fouling. Exception was represented by long-chained perfluoroalkyl-ated substances (i.e., PFOA, PFDA and PFOS). Indeed, adsorption of these compounds resulted independent of water quality. In this study was also investigated the applicability of UV254 and fluorescing PARAFAC components to act as surrogates in predicting EOCs removal by GAC in different water matrices. Empirical linear correlation for the investigated EOCs were determined with UV254 and fluorescing components in all water qualities. However, fluorescence measure-ments resulted more sensitive than UV254 to predict EOC breakthrough during GAC adsorption. When the data from all water qualities was combined, good correlations between the microbial humic-like PARAFAC component and EOC removals were still observed and they resulted in-dependent of water quality if considering only real water matrices (wastewater and surface water). On the contrary, correlations between EOC removals and UV254 removals were independent of water quality when combining data of surface waters and synthetic water, but a different cor-relation model was needed to predict EOCs breakthrough in wastewater."
Downstream trends of in vitro bioassay responses in a wastewater effluent-dominated river,Aug 2018,"Surface waters are becoming increasingly influenced by wastewater effluents due to drought conditions, growing populations, and urbanization. These effluents contain mixtures of trace organic compounds (TOrCs), including bioactive constituents, which are not fully attenuated by conventional wastewater treatment systems. This study investigated the occurrence of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and estrogen receptor (ER) activity, as well as the overall toxicity to bacteria (BLT-Screen), in the effluent of two wastewater reclamation facilities (WRF) and downstream of the Lower Santa Cruz River, Pima County, Arizona USA, which is dominated by the WRF effluents. The GR, AhR, and ER activities and toxicity to bacteria were determined by in vitro bioassays during four seasons. Bioassay results showed the highest activities at the wastewater outfalls, with activities decreasing downstream of the river. Biological equivalent concentrations ranged from 9 to 170 ng/L dexamethasone-equivalents (DexEQ), 0.1-0.8 ng/L 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-equivalents (TCDDEQ), and <0.005-0.8 ng/L estradiol equivalents (EEQ) for GR-, AhR- and ER-mediated activity, respectively. This level of biological activity at times exceeded the relevant effects-based trigger value for environmental effects, indicating a potential risk to the receiving environment. Toxicity to bacteria was low at all sites, well below the trigger value of 1.0 TUIC20, which represents an undiluted water sample causing 20% toxicity in the assay. The potential inducing glucocorticoid agonists were further analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Analytical results reveal triamcinolone acetonide as the most abundant glucocorticoid with concentrations up to 38 ng/L. Similar results for DexEQ concentrations calculated from both chemical and bioassay data indicate a successful mass balance for glucocorticoids. This mass balance illustrated lower DexEQ during summer months, which could be due to an increased attenuation from photodegradation."
Near Real-Time Detection of E. coli in Reclaimed Water,Jul 2018,"Advanced treatment of reclaimed water prior to potable reuse normally results in the inactivation of bacterial populations, however, incremental treatment failure can result in bacteria, including pathogens, remaining viable. Therefore, potential microorganisms need to be detected in real-time to preclude potential adverse human health effects. Real-time detection of microbes presents unique problems which are dependent on the water quality of the test water, including parameters such as particulate content and turbidity, and natural organic matter content. In addition, microbes are unusual in that: (i) viability and culturability are not always synonymous; (ii) viability in water can be reduced by osmotic stress; and (iii) bacteria can invoke repair mechanisms in response to UV disinfection resulting in regrowth of bacterial populations. All these issues related to bacteria affect the efficacy of real-time detection for bacteria. Here we evaluate three different sensors suitable for specific water qualities. The sensor A is an on-line, real-time sensor that allows for the continuous monitoring of particulates (including microbial contaminants) using multi-angle-light scattering (MALS) technology. The sensor B is a microbial detection system that uses optical technique, Mie light scattering, for particle sizing and fluorescence emission for viable bacteria detection. The last sensor C was based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. E. coli was used a model organism and out of all tested sensors, we found the sensor C to be the most accurate. It has a great potential as a surrogate parameter for microbial loads in test waters and be useful for process control in treatment trains."
An integrated approach with the zebrafish model for biomonitoring of municipal wastewater effluent and receiving waters,Dec 2017,"Comprehensive monitoring of water pollution is challenging. With the increasing amount and types of anthropogenic compounds being released into water, there are rising concerns of undetected toxicity. This is especially true for municipal wastewater effluents that are discharged to surface waters. This study was designed to integrate zebrafish toxicogenomics, targeted gene expression, and morphological analyses, for toxicity evaluation of effluent discharged from two previously characterized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Pima County, Arizona, and their receiving surface water. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to organic extracts from the WWTP1 effluent that were reconstituted to represent 1× and 0.5× of the original concentration. Microarray analyses identified deregulated gene probes that mapped to 1666, 779, and 631 unique human homologs in the 1×, 0.5×, and the intersection of both groups, respectively. These were associated with 18 cellular and molecular functions ranging from cell cycle to metabolism and are involved in the development and function of 10 organ systems including nervous, cardiovascular, haematological, reproductive, and hepatic systems. Superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis, retinoic acid receptor activation, glucocorticoid receptor and prolactin signaling were among the top 11 perturbed canonical pathways. Real-time quantitative PCR validated the expression changes of 12 selected genes. These genes were then tested on zebrafish embryos exposed to the reconstituted extract of water sampled downstream of WWTP1 and another nearby WWTP2. The expression of several targeted genes were significantly affected by the WWTP effluents and some of the downstream receiving waters. Morphological analyses using four transgenic zebrafish lines revealed potential toxicity associated with nervous, hepatic, endothelial-vascular and myeloid systems. This study demonstrated how information can be obtained using adverse outcome pathway framework to derive biological effect-based monitoring tools. This integrated approach using zebrafish can supplement analytical chemistry to provide more comprehensive monitoring of discharged effluents and their receiving waters."
Management strategies for trace organic chemicals in water – A review of international approaches,Dec 2017,"To ensure an appropriate management of potential health risks and uncertainties from the release of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) into the aqueous environment, many countries have evaluated and implemented strategies to manage TOrCs. The aim of this study was to evaluate existing management strategies for TOrCs in different countries to derive and compare underlying core principles and paradigms and to develop suggestions for more holistic management strategies to protect the environment and drinking water supplies from the discharge of undesired TOrCs. The strategies in different industrial countries were summarized and subsequently compared with regards to three particular questions: 1) Do the approaches different countries have implemented manage all or only specific portions of the universe of chemicals; 2) What implementation and compliance strategies are used to manage aquatic and human health risk and what are their pros and cons; and 3) How are site-specific watershed differences being addressed? While management strategies of the different countries target similar TOrCs, the programs differ in several important aspects, including underlying principles, the balance between aquatic or human health protection, implementation methods, and financing mechanisms used to fund regulatory programs."
Sample handling and data processing for fluorescent excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of dissolved organic matter (DOM),Nov 2017,"In environmental engineering and science, fluorescent excitation-emission matrix (EEM) has increasingly been utilized to characterize chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). This study aims to delineate EEM data processing, including calculation of total fluorescence (TF) which is an emerging water quality parameter often used as a surrogate for micropollutant removal by advanced water treatment processes. In addition, sample handling procedures such as storage, use of preservatives, and oxidant quenching agents were evaluated. In this study, three antimicrobial preservatives were tested: sodium azide, sodium omadine, and thymol. All the tested preservatives altered optical properties of samples, and were therefore not suitable for the preservation of EEM samples. Without preservative, storage of samples at 4 °C maintained TF within 7.5% of its original value for 21 days, while TF of samples stored at the room temperature more drastically changed (up to 15%). The impacts of three oxidant quenching agents including ascorbic acid, sodium bisulfite, and sodium thiosulfate on EEM were also tested. Among the quenching agents, sodium bisulfite was found to be suitable since it little influenced optical properties of samples while the other two were not favorable due to interference. We also scrutinized the use of TF as surrogate to monitor micropollutant rejection by nanofiltration membrane."
N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and its precursors in water and wastewater: A review on formation and removal,Oct 2017,"This review summarizes major findings over the last decade related to N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in water and wastewater. In particular, the review is focused on the removal of NDMA and of its precursors by conventional and advanced water and wastewater treatment processes. New information regarding formation mechanisms and precursors are discussed as well. NDMA precursors are generally of anthropogenic origin and their main source in water have been recognized to be wastewater discharges. Chloramination is the most common process that results in formation of NDMA during water and wastewater treatment. However, ozonation of wastewater or highly contaminated surface water can also generate significant levels of NDMA. Thus, NDMA formation control and remediation has become of increasing interest, particularly during treatment of wastewater-impacted water and during potable reuse application. NDMA formation has also been associated with the use of quaternary amine-based coagulants and anion exchange resins. UV photolysis with UV fluence far higher than typical disinfection doses is generally considered the most efficient technology for NDMA mitigation. However, recent studies on the optimization of biological processes offer a potentially lower-energy solution. Options for NDMA control include attenuation of precursor materials through physical removal, biological treatment, and/or deactivation by application of oxidants. Nevertheless, NDMA precursor identification and removal can be challenging and additional research and optimization is needed. As municipal wastewater becomes increasingly used as a source water for drinking, NDMA formation and mitigation strategies will become increasingly more important. The following review provides a summary of the most recent information available."
Reducing ultrafiltration membrane fouling during potable water reuse using pre-ozonation,Aug 2017,"Wastewater reclamation has increasingly become popular to secure potable water supply. Low-pressure membrane processes such as microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) play imperative roles as a barrier of macromolecules for such purpose, but are often limited by membrane fouling. Effluent organic matter (EfOM), including biopolymers and particulates, in secondary wastewater effluents have been known to be major foulants in low-pressure membrane processes. Hence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pre-ozonation as a pre-treatment for UF on the membrane fouling caused by EfOM in secondary wastewater effluents for hydrophilic regenerated cellulose (RC) and hydrophobic polyethersulfone (PES) UF membranes. It was found that greater fouling reduction was achieved by pre-ozonation for the hydrophilic RC membrane than the hydrophobic PES membrane at increasing ozone doses. In addition, the physicochemical property changes of EfOM, including biopolymer fractions, by pre-ozonation were systemically investigated. The classical pore blocking model and the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theories were employed to scrutinize the fouling alleviation mechanism by pre-ozonation. As a result, the overarching mechanisms of fouling reduction were attributed to the following key reasons: (1) Ozone degraded macromolecules such as biopolymers like proteins and polysaccharides into smaller fractions, thereby increasing free energy of cohesion of EfOM and rendering them more hydrophilic and stable; (2) pre-ozonation augmented the interfacial free energy of adhesion between foulants and the RC/PES membranes, leading to the increase of repulsions and/or the decrease of attractions; and (3) pre-ozonation prolonged the transition from pore blocking to cake filtration that was a dominant fouling mechanism, thereby reducing fouling."
Predicting trace organic compound attenuation by ozone oxidation: Development of indicator and surrogate models,Apr 2017,"Ozone oxidation has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment process for the attenuation of trace organic compounds (TOrCs); however, predicting TOrC attenuation by ozone processes is challenging in wastewaters. Since ozone is rapidly consumed, determining the exposure times of ozone and hydroxyl radical proves to be difficult. As direct potable reuse schemes continue to gain traction, there is an increasing need for the development of real-time monitoring strategies for TOrC abatement in ozone oxidation processes. Hence, this study is primarily aimed at developing indicator and surrogate models for the prediction of TOrC attenuation by ozone oxidation. To this end, the second-order kinetic equations with a second-phase Rct value (ratio of hydroxyl radical exposure to molecular ozone exposure) were used to calculate comparative kinetics of TOrC attenuation and the reduction of indicator and spectroscopic surrogate parameters, including UV absorbance at 254 nm (UVA254) and total fluorescence (TF). The developed indicator model using meprobamate as an indicator compound and the surrogate models with UVA254 and TF exhibited good predictive power for the attenuation of 13 kinetically distinct TOrCs in five filtered and unfiltered wastewater effluents (R² values > 0.8). This study is intended to help provide a guideline for the implementation of indicator/surrogate models for real-time monitoring of TOrC abatement with ozone processes and integrate them into a regulatory framework in water reuse."
Development of Fluorescence Surrogates to Predict the Photochemical Transformation of Pharmaceuticals in Wastewater Effluents,Feb 2017,"The photochemical transformation of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater effluents is an emerging concern for environmental scientists. In the current study, the photodegradation of 29 PPCPs was examined in effluents under simulated solar irradiation. Direct photodegradation, triplet state effluent organic matter (3EfOM*)-mediated and hydroxyl radical (HO•)-mediated degradation are three major pathways in the removal process. With the photodegradation of trace levels of PPCPs, the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence intensities of the effluents were also gradually reduced. Therefore, fluorescence peaks have been identified, for the first time, as appropriate surrogates to assess the photodegradation of PPCPs. The humic-like fluorescence peak is linked to direct photolysis-labile PPCPs, such as naproxen, ronidazole, diclofenac, ornidazole, tinidazole, chloramphenicol, flumequine, ciprofloxacin, methadone, and dimetridazole. The tyrosine-like EEM peak is associated with HO•/CO3•--labile PPCPs, such as trimethoprim, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, carbamazepine, and cephalexin. The tryptophan-like peak is associated with 3EfOM*-labile PPCPs, such as clenbuterol, metoprolol, venlafaxine, bisphenol A, propranolol, ractopamine, salbutamol, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, famotidine, terbutaline, and erythromycin. The reduction in EEM fluorescence correlates well with the removal of PPCPs, allowing a model to be constructed. The solar-driven removal of EEM fluorescence was applied to predict the attenuation of 11 PPCPs in five field samples. A close correlation between the predicted results and the experimental results suggests that fluorescence may be a suitable surrogate for monitoring the solar-driven photodegradation of PPCPs in effluents."
Concentrations of select dissolved trace elements and anthropogenic organic compounds in the Mississippi River and major tributaries during the summer of 2012 and 2013,Feb 2017,"The Mississippi River drainage basin includes the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas rivers. These rivers drain areas with different physiography, population centers, and land use, with each contributing a different suites of metals and wastewater contaminants that can affect water quality. In July 2012, we determined 18 elements (Be, Rb, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the five major tributaries and in the Upper Mississippi River. The following summer, we determined both trace elements and 25 trace organic compounds at 10 sites in a longitudinal study of the main stem of the Mississippi River from Grafton, Illinois to Natchez, Mississippi. We detected wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, throughout the river system, with the highest concentrations occurring near urban centers (St. Louis and Memphis). Concentrations were highest for atrazine (673 ng L⁻¹), DEET (540 ng L⁻¹), TCPP (231 ng L⁻¹), and caffeine (202 ng L⁻¹). The Illinois, Missouri, and Yazoo rivers, which drain areas with intense agriculture, had relatively high concentrations of Chl-a and atrazine. However, the Ohio River delivered higher loads of contaminants to the Mississippi River, including an estimated 177 kg day⁻¹ of atrazine, due to higher flow volumes. Concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cd, and Zn) were relatively high in the Illinois River and low in the Ohio River, although dissolved metal concentrations were below US EPA maximum contaminant levels for surface water. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the rivers can be distinguished based on elemental and contaminant profiles."
Common deregulated gene expression profiles and morphological changes in developing zebrafish larvae exposed to environmental-relevant high to low concentrations of glucocorticoids,Jan 2017,"Synthetic glucocorticoids have been detected in environmental waters and their biological potency have raised concerns of their impact on aquatic vertebrates especially fish. In this study, developing zebrafish larvae exposed to representative glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone and triamcinolone) at 50 pM to 50 nM from 3 h post-fertilisation to 5 days post-fertilisation were investigated. Microarray analysis identified 1255, 1531, and 2380 gene probes, which correspondingly mapped to 660, 882 and 1238 human/rodent homologs, as deregulated by dexamethasone, prednisolone and triamcinolone, respectively. A total of 248 gene probes which mapped to 159 human/rodent homologs were commonly deregulated by the three glucocorticoids. These homologs were associated with over 20 molecular functions from cell cycle to cellular metabolisms, and were involved in the development and function of connective tissue, nervous, haematological, and digestive systems. Glucocorticoid receptor signalling, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and RAR signalling were among the top perturbed canonical pathways. Morphological analyses using four transgenic zebrafish lines revealed that the hepatic and endothelial-vascular systems were affected by all three glucocorticoids while nervous, pancreatic and myeloid cell systems were affected by one of them. Quantitative real-time PCR detected significant change in the expression of seven genes at 50 pM of all three glucocorticoids, a concentration comparable to total glucocorticoids reported in environmental waters. Three genes (cry2b, fbxo32, and klhl38b) responded robustly to all glucocorticoid concentrations tested. The common deregulated genes with the associated biological processes and morphological changes can be used for biological inference of glucocorticoid exposure in fish for future studies."
"Analysis of Haloacetic acids, Bromate, and Dalapon in Natural Waters by Ion Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Jan 2017,"The addition of oxidants for disinfecting water can lead to the formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds referred to as disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are one of the most widely detected DBPs in US water utilities and some of them are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The present study developed a method to analyze all the compounds in the USEPA method 557 (nine HAAs, bromate and dalapon) plus four potentially more toxic iodinated HAAs in water by coupling ion chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (IC-MS/MS). This aqueous direct injection method has significant advantages over traditional GC methods, which require a derivatization and sample extraction that are laborious, time-consuming, and can negatively impact reproducibility. The method developed in this study requires half the time of the current USEPA method 557 on IC–MS/MS while including more compounds and achieving sub-μg/L level method detection limits (MDLs) for all 15 target analytes. The single laboratory lowest concentration minimum reporting level (LCMRL) has also been determined in reagent water, which ranged from 0.011 to 0.62 μg/L for the analytes. The mean recoveries of the analytes during matrix spike recovery tests were 77–125% in finished drinking water and 81–112% in surface water. This method was then applied to untreated, chlorinated, and chloraminated groundwater and surface water samples. Bromate and 9 HAAs were detected at different levels in some of these samples."
Spatial Models of Sewer Pipe Leakage Predict the Occurrence of Wastewater Indicators in Shallow Urban Groundwater,Dec 2016,"Twentieth century municipal wastewater infrastructure greatly improved U.S. urban public health and water quality. However, sewer pipes deteriorate and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (δ18O). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater. Such understanding could direct sewer infrastructure reinvestment towards water resource protection."
Pre-ozonation for high recovery of nanofiltration (NF) membrane system: Membrane fouling reduction and trace organic compound attenuation,Sep 2016,"This study demonstrated the use of nanofiltration (NF) membrane with pre-ozonation for surface water brine treatment. Pre-ozonation, used for fouling control, with relatively low ozone doses (0.1−0.4 mg O3/mg DOC ratios) significantly reduced organic fouling potential. A classical pore blocking model revealed that the dominant fouling mechanism was cake filtration. Based on a statistical correlation test, macromolecules (apparent molecular weight >10k Da) of typtophan-like aromatic protein and soluble microbial-like matter exhibited strong correlation to fouling potential. Small molecules (<1600 Da) of UV-absorbing matter were also correlated with fouling potential whereas bulk parameters such as SUVA displayed relatively lower correlation with fouling potential. Trace organic compound (TOrC) attenuation by ozone, membranes, and combination of ozone and membranes were also examined. Greater than 70% removal of the 17 TOrCs was achieved at 0.4 mg O3/mg DOC ratio. The NF membrane (NF90) alone also could remove more than 90% of TOrCs. When pre-ozonation was performed with the NF membrane, all TOrCs tested were removed to less than the limits of detection. In conclusion, the application of pre-ozonation to NF membrane not only can alleviate organic fouling potential, but also can function as a dual barrier for ensuring removal of TOrCs for water treatment."
"Critical assessment of the ubiquitous occurrence and fate of the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide in water",Sep 2016,"The insect repellent diethyltoluamide (DEET) is among the most frequently detected organic chemical contaminants in water across a wide range of geographies from around the world. These observations are raising critical questions and increasing concerns regarding potential environmental relevance, particularly when the emergence of severe neurological conditions attributed to the Zika virus has increased the use of insect repellents. After dermal application, DEET is washed from the skin when bathing and enters the municipal sewer system before discharge into the environment. Mainly measured by gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS or LC-MS), more than 200 peer-reviewed publications have already reported concentrations of DEET ranging ng/L to mg/L in several water matrices from North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and more recently Africa and South America. While conventional wastewater treatment technology has limited capacity of removal, advanced technologies are capable of better attenuation and could lower the environmental discharge of organic contaminants, including DEET. For instance, adsorption on activated carbon, desalinating membrane processes (nanofiltration and reverse osmosis), ozonation, and advanced oxidation processes can achieve 50% to essentially 100% DEET attenuation. Despite the abundant literature on the topic, the ubiquity of DEET in the environment still raises questions due to the apparent lack of obvious spatio-temporal trends in concentrations measured in surface water, which does not fit the expected usage pattern of insect repellents. Moreover, two recent studies showed discrepancies between the concentrations obtained by GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. While the occurrence of DEET in the environment is well established, the concentrations reported should be interpreted cautiously, considering the disparities in methodologies applied and occurrence patterns observed. Therefore, this manuscript provides a critical overview of the origin of DEET in the environment, the relevant analytical methods, the occurrence reported in peer-reviewed literature, and the attenuation efficacy of water treatment processes."
Online solid phase extraction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for determination of estrogens and glucocorticoids in water,Aug 2016,"The present work describes the development of a novel fully automated online solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using negative electrospray ionisation (ESI) for the simultaneous determination of six estrogens and six glucocorticoids in water. Filtered water samples (5mL) were preconcentrated on a HyperSep™ Retain PEP SPE cartridge, eluted in back-flush mode, and separated on an LC column before analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The total analysis time for each sample was 17min. Different experimental parameters such as the type of online SPE cartridge, loading flow rate, and composition of methanol in the loading phase were optimised. The intra-day repeatability of method ranged from 1.48 to 9.68% for all analytes, and the inter-day reproducibility ranged from 2.03 to 8.63% for all analytes, except for dexamethasone at 11.95%. These were calculated based on the peak area responses of the targeted analytes spiked at 50ng/L in ultrapure water. The method also showed good linearity from 1 to 100ng/L, with the limits of detection (LODs) ranging from 0.16 to 2.14ng/L. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of municipal wastewater. This fully automated online SPE extraction coupled with LC-MS/MS method is effective and reliable to measure estrogens and glucocorticoids simultaneously due to its high throughput, relatively low solvent consumption, reusability of the online SPE cartridge, and reduction of manual labor."
Predicting trace organic compound attenuation with spectroscopic parameters in powdered activated carbon processes,Aug 2016,"The removal of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) is of growing interest in water research and society. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) has been proven to be an effective method of removal for TOrCs in water, with the degree of effectiveness depending on dosage, contact time, and activated carbon type. In this study, the attenuation of TOrCs in three different secondary wastewater effluents using four PAC materials was studied in order to elucidate the effectiveness and efficacy of PAC for TOrC removal. With the notable exception of hydrochlorothiazide, all 14 TOrC indicators tested in this study exhibited a positive correlation of removal rate with their log Dow values, demonstrating that the main adsorption mechanism was hydrophobic interaction. As a predictive model, the modified Chick-Watson model, often used for the prediction of microorganism inactivation by disinfectants, was applied. The applied model exhibited good predictive power for TOrC attenuation by PAC in wastewater. In addition, surrogate models based upon spectroscopic measurements including UV absorbance at 254 nm and total fluorescence were applied to predict TOrC removal by PAC. The surrogate model was found to provide an excellent prediction of TOrC attenuation for all combinations of water quality and PAC type included in this study. The success of spectrometric parameters as surrogates in predicting TOrC attenuation by PAC are particularly useful because of their potential application in real-time on-line sensor monitoring and process control at full-scale water treatment plants, which could lead to significantly reduced operator response times and PAC operational optimization."

Sonochemical degradation of perfluorinated chemicals in aqueous film-forming foams,May 2016,"Aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) are complex mixtures containing 1-5% w/w fluorocarbons (FCs). Here, we have investigated degradation of two commercial AFFF formulations, 3 M and Ansul, using sound field at 500 kHz and 1 MHz with varying initial concentrations ranging from 200 to 930 x dilution. The foams were readily degraded by 1 MHz, with percentage of defluorination ranging from 11.1 ± 1.4% (200 x dilution of 3 M) to 47.1 ± 5.8% (500 x dilution of Ansul). Removal of total organic carbon (TOC) ranged from 16.0 ± 1.4% (200 x dilution Ansul) to 39.0 ± 7.2% (500 x dilution Ansul). Degradation of AFFF was affected by sound frequency with rates of defluorination 10-fold greater when the frequency was 1 MHz than when it was 500 kHz. Mineralization of TOC was 1.5- to 3.0-fold greater under 1 MHz than 500 kHz. Rate of fluoride release was 60% greater for the greatest initial concentration of FC in Ansul compared to the least initial concentration. While the rate of mineralization of AFFF was directly proportional to the initial concentration of Ansul, that was not the case for 3 M, where the rates of mineralization were approximately the same for all three initial concentrations. Results of the study demonstrate that sonolysis is a promising technology to effectively treat AFFFs."
Biliary Elimination of Pemetrexed Is Dependent on Mrp2 in Rats: Potential Mechanism of Variable Response in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis,May 2016,"Hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) provides the biliary elimination pathway for many xenobiotics. Disruption of this pathway contributes to retention of these compounds and may ultimately lead to adverse drug reactions. MRP2 mislocalization from the canalicular membrane has been observed in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the late stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is characterized by fat accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. MRP2/Mrp2 mislocalization is observed in both human NASH and the rodent methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet model, but the extent to which it impacts overall transport capacity of MRP2 is unknown. Pemetrexed is an antifolate chemotherapeutic indicated for non-small cell lung cancer, yet its hepatobiliary elimination pathway has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to quantify the loss of Mrp2 function in NASH using an obligate Mrp2 transport substrate. To determine whether pemetrexed is an obligate Mrp2 substrate, its cumulative biliary elimination was compared between wild-type and Mrp2(-/-) rats. No pemetrexed was detected in the bile of Mrp2(-/-) rats, indicating pemetrexed is completely reliant upon Mrp2 function for biliary elimination. Comparing the biliary elimination of pemetrexed between MCD and control animals identified a transporter-dependent decrease in biliary excretion of 60% in NASH. This study identifies Mrp2 as the exclusive biliary elimination mechanism for pemetrexed, making it a useful in vivo probe substrate for Mrp2 function, and quantifying the loss of function in NASH. This mechanistic feature may provide useful insight into the impact of NASH on inter-individual variability in response to pemetrexed."
A novel brine precipitation process for higher water recovery,May 2016,"A three-step demineralization process for removing scale-forming substances from brine solutions produced from nanofiltration (NF) of water was developed. The process is designed to remove substances that would lead to scale and membrane fouling during additional stages of NF or reverse osmosis (RO). Tests were performed to determine the most suitable dosages and mixing times for each reagent. The first step in the demineralization process employs ferric chloride for removing phosphonate scale inhibitors via co-precipitation with ferric hydroxide. The second step of the process increases the solution pH value to promote carbonate mineral precipitation. The third step involves barium sulfate precipitation promoted by barite seed crystals. Saturation indices for precipitation of mineral solids were simulated using the Phreeqc thermodynamic modeling program.Water recovery from the treated brines was modeled using the ROSA package for simulating permeate and concentrate compositions for NF processes. The three-step demineralization process allowed the recovery rate for the brine solution to be as high as the initial feed water, and achieved a total water recovery of >97%."
Use of fluorescence EEM to monitor the removal of emerging contaminants in full scale wastewater treatment plants,May 2016,"This study investigated the applicability of different techniques for fluorescence excitation/emission matrices data interpretations, including peak-picking method, fluorescence regional integration and PARAFAC modelling, to act as surrogates in predicting emerging trace organic compounds (ETOrCs) removal during conventional wastewater treatments that usually comprise primary and secondary treatments. Results showed that fluorescence indexes developed using alternative methodologies but indicative of a same dissolved organic matter component resulted in similar predictions of the removal of the target compounds. The peak index defined by the excitation/emission wavelength positions (λex/λem) 225/290 nm and related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine-like fluorescence was determined to be a particularly suitable surrogate for monitoring ETOrCs that had very high removal rates (average removal >70%) (i.e., triclosan, caffeine and ibuprofen). The peak index defined by λex/λem = 245/440 nm and the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima λex/λem = 245, 350/450, both identified as humic-like fluorescence, were found remarkably well correlated with ETOrCs such as atenolol, naproxen and gemfibrozil that were moderately removed (51-70% average removal). Finally, the PARAFAC component with wavelength of the maxima λex/λem = < 240, 315/380 identified as microbial humic-like fluorescence was the only index correlated with the removal of the antibiotic trimethoprim (average removal 68%)."

"Occurrence and fate of emerging trace organic chemicals in wastewater plants in Chennai, India",Apr 2016,"The presence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, pesticides and industrial contaminants collectively termed as trace organic compounds (TOrCs) in wastewater has been well-documented in USA, Europe, China and other regions. However, data from India, the second most populous country in the world is severely lacking. This study investigated the occurrence and concentrations of twenty-two indicator TOrCs at three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South India serving diverse communities across three sampling campaigns. Samples were collected after each WWTP treatment unit and removal efficiencies for TOrCs were determined. Eleven TOrCs were detected in every sample from every location at all sites, while only five TOrCs were detected consistently in effluent samples. Caffeine was present at greatest concentration in the influent of all three plants with average concentrations ranging between 56 and 65μg/L. In contrast, the x-ray contrast media pharmaceutical, iohexol, was the highest detected compound on average in the effluent at all three WWTPs (2.1-8.7μg/L). TOrCs were not completely removed in the WWTPs with removal efficiencies being compound specific and most of the attenuation being attributed to the biological treatment processes. Caffeine and triclocarban were well removed (>80%), while other compounds were poorly removed (acesulfame, sucralose, iohexol) or maybe even formed (carbamazepine) within the WWTPs. The effluent composition of the 22 TOrCs were similar within the three WWTPs but quite different to those seen in the US, indicating the importance of region-specific monitoring. Diurnal trends indicated that variability is compound specific but trended within certain classes of compounds (artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals). The data collected on TOrCs from this study can be used as a baseline to identify potential remediation and regulatory strategies in this understudied region of India."
Understanding acoustic cavitation for sonolytic degradation of p-cresol as a model contaminant,Mar 2016,"Many modern techniques exist for the degradation of organic pollutants in water. Numerous treatment processes which utilize the formation of hydroxyl radicals for oxidation of pollutants have been studied thoroughly. In this study, a three pronged approach has been used to characterize and understand the effect of two distinct acoustic frequencies (37 kHz and 1 MHz) on cavitation behavior. Correlation of this behavior with sonolysis of a target phenol pollutant is described. Hydroxyl radical capture, hydrophone, and microelectrode studies in this work show that megasonic frequencies are more effective for generation of hydroxyl radicals and stable cavitation events than ultrasonic frequencies. UV absorption and fluorescence measurements confirm that the combination of ultrasonic sonolysis with a Fenton reagent achieved complete degradation of p-cresol at 50 mg/L in about 30 min. Cost estimates have been made for different sonication processes and compared with traditional advanced oxidation processes."

"Organic Contaminant Abatement in Reclaimed Water by UV/H 2 O 2 and a Combined Process consisting of O 3 /H 2 O 2 followed by UV/H 2 O 2 : Prediction of abatement efficiency, energy consumption, and by-product formation",Feb 2016,"UV/H2O2 processes can be applied to improve the quality of effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants by attenuating trace organic contaminants (micropollutants). This study presents a kinetic model based on UV photolysis parameters, including UV absorption rate and quantum yield, and hydroxyl radical (●OH) oxidation parameters, including second-order rate constants for ●OH reactions and steady-state ●OH concentrations, that can be used to predict micropollutant abatement in wastewater. The UV/H2O2 kinetic model successfully predicted the abatement efficiencies of 16 target micropollutants in bench-scale UV and UV/H2O2 experiments in 10 secondary wastewater effluents. The model was then used to calculate the electric energies required to achieve specific levels of micropollutant abatement in several advanced wastewater treatment scenarios using various combinations of ozone, UV, and H2O2. UV/H2O2 is more energy-intensive than ozonation for abatement of most micropollutants. Nevertheless, UV/H2O2 is not limited by the formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and bromate whereas ozonation may produce significant concentrations of these oxidation by-products, as observed in some of the tested wastewater effluents. The combined process of O3/H2O2 followed by UV/H2O2, which may be warranted in some potable reuse applications, can achieve superior micropollutant abatement with reduced energy consumption compared to UV/H2O2 and reduced oxidation by-product formation (i.e., NDMA and/or bromate) compared to conventional ozonation."
Balancing the Budget: Accounting for Glucocorticoid Bioactivity and Fate during Water Treatment,Feb 2016,"Numerous studies have identified the presence and bioactivity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) active substances in water; however, the identification and activity-balance of GR compounds remained elusive. This study determined the occurrence and attenuation of GR bioactivity and closed the balance by determining those substances responsible. The observed in vitro GR activity ranged from 39-155 ng dexamethasone-equivalent/L (ng Dex-EQ/L) in the secondary effluents of four wastewater treatment plants. Monochromatic ultraviolet light of 80 mJ/cm2 disinfection dose was efficient for GR activity photolysis, whereas chlorination could not appreciably attenuate the observed GR activity. Ozonation was effective only at relatively high dose (ozone:TOC 1:1). Microfiltration membranes were not efficient for GR activity attenuation; however, reverse osmosis removed GR activity to levels below the limits of detection. A high sensitive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was then developed to screen twenty-seven GR agonists. Twelve were identified and quantified in effluents at summed concentrations of 9.6-21.2 ng/L. The summed Dex-EQ of individual compounds based on their measured concentrations was in excellent agreement with the Dex-EQ obtained from bioassay, which demonstrated that the detected glucocorticoids can entirely explain the observed GR bioactivity. Four synthetic glucocorticoids (triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, clobetasol propionate, and fluticasone propionate) predominantly accounted for GR activity. These data represent the first known publication where a complete activity balance has been determined for GR agonists in aquatic environment."
N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation during ozonation of wastewater and water treatment polymers,Feb 2016,"N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation by ozonation was investigated in the effluents of four different wastewater treatment plants destined for alternative reuse. Very high levels of NDMA formation were observed in wastewaters from treatment plants non operating with biological nitrogen removal. Selected experiments showed that hydroxyl radical did not have a significant role in NDMA formation during ozonation of wastewater. Furthermore, ozonation of three different polymers used for water treatment, including polyDADMAC, anionic polyacrylamide, and cationic polyacrylamide, spiked in wastewater did not increase the NDMA formation. Effluent organic matter (EfOM) likely reduced the availability of ozone in water able to react with polymers and quenched the produced $OH radicals which limited polymer degradation and subsequent NDMA production. Excellent correlations were observed between NDMA formation, UV absorbance at 254 nm, and total fluorescence reduction. These data provide evidence that UV and fluorescence surrogates could be used for monitoring and/or controlling NDMA formation during ozonation."

Metformin Scavenges Methylglyoxal To Form a Novel Imidazolinone Metabolite in Humans,Jan 2016,"Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound involved in the formation of advanced glycation endproducts. Levels of MG are elevated in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) have been implicated in the progression of diabetic complications. The anti-hyperglycemic drug metformin (MF) has been suggested to be a scavenger of MG. The present work examined and characterized unequivocally the resulting scavenged product from the metformin-MG reaction. The primary product was characterized by 1H, 13C, 2D-HSQC and HMBC NMR, and tandem mass spectrometry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis determined the structure of the metformin and MG-derived imidazolinone compound to be (E)-1,1-dimethyl-2-(5-methyl-4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)guanidine (IMZ). A LC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring method was developed to detect and quantify the presence of IMZ in metformin-treated T2DM patients. Urine from >90 MF-treated T2DM patients was analyzed, with increased levels of MF directly correlating with elevations in IMZ. Urinary MF was detected in the range of 0.17 μM - 23.0 mM, and simultaneous measurement of IMZ concentrations were in the range of 18.8 nM to 4.3 μM. Since plasma concentrations of MG range from 40 nM to 4.5 μM the level of IMZ production may be of therapeutic significance. Thus, in addition to lowering hepatic gluconeogenesis, metformin also scavenges the highly reactive MG in vivo, thereby reducing potentially detrimental MG protein adducts, with subsequent reductions in diabetic complications."
Ozonation of Cylindrospermopsin (Cyanotoxin): Degradation Mechanisms and Cytotoxicity Assessments,Jan 2016,"Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a potent toxic alkaloid produced by a number of cyanobacteria frequently found in lakes and reservoirs used as drinking water sources. We report for the first time the detailed pathways for the degradation of CYN by treatment with ozone. This was accomplished using UHPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF), which revealed that CYN is readily degraded by ozone with at least 36 transformation products. The structural similarities from the major products indicated that the carbon-carbon double bond in the uracil ring of CYN was most susceptible to attack by ozone. Furthermore, the nitrogen functionality associated with the tricyclic guanidine moiety is also involved via a degradation pathway which has not been previously observed. To assess the potential toxicity of the ozonation products of CYN, the cytotoxicity of CYN and the mixture of its ozonation products were measured using a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). The IC50 for CYN at 24 and 48 hr incubations was approximately 64.1 and 12.5 μM, respectively; however, the ozonation products of CYN did not exhibit measurable cytotoxicity to human cells. The results indicate ozone is an effective and practical method for CYN attenuation in water treatment without formation of overtly toxic transformation products."
Emerging Investigators Series: Prediction of Trace Organic Contaminant Abatement with UV/H 2 O 2 : Development and Validation of Semi-Empirical Models for Municipal Wastewater Effluents,Jan 2016,"Recent evaluations of potable reuse treatment trains suggest that the use of UV and UV/H2O2 may become increasingly common, particularly in systems employing ozone and/or biofiltration. This study provides a summary of photolysis rate constants and OH rate constants and demonstrates the applicability of semiempirical relationships predicting OH exposure and trace organic contaminant (TOrC) abatement with UV/ H2O2 in matrices with low UV transmittance (e.g., <80%). The data are based on bench-scale experiments with 17 target compounds in 10 laboratory-filtered secondary wastewater effluents. As an alternative to OH exposure measurements with probe compounds, three different approaches for considering the impacts of matrix-specific OH scavenging on TOrC abatement are proposed: (1) estimation of ROH,UV (i.e., OH exposure per UV dose); (2) estimation of kUV/DOC, the pseudo first order rate constant based on the UV/DOC (dissolved organic carbon) ratio; and (3) assessment of TOrC abatement based on differential UV254 absorbance or fluorescence. The level of laboratory investment varies with each approach, but there is a tradeoff in the accuracy of the predictions and whether they typically overestimate or underestimate actual TOrC abatement."

Wastewater Compounds in Urban Shallow Groundwater Wells Correspond to Exfiltration Probabilities of Nearby Sewers,Nov 2015,"Wastewater compounds are frequently detected in urban shallow groundwater. Sources include sewage or reclaimed wastewater, but origins are often unknown. In a prior study, wastewater compounds were quantified in waters sampled from shallow groundwater wells in a small coastal California city. Here, we resampled those wells and expanded sample analyses to include sewage-or reclaimed water-specific indicators, i.e. pharmaceutical and personal care product chemicals or disinfection byproducts. Also, we developed a geographic information system (GIS)-based model of sanitary sewer exfiltration prob-abilitydcombining a published pipe failure model accounting for sewer pipe size, age, materials of construction, with interpolated depths to groundwaterdto determine if sewer system attributes relate to wastewater compounds in urban shallow groundwater. Across the wells, groundwater samples contained varying wastewater compounds, including acesulfame, sucralose, bisphenol A, 4-tert-octylphenol, estrone and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Fecal indicator bacterial concentrations and toxicological bioactivities were less than known benchmarks. However, the reclaimed water in this study was positive for all bioactivity tested. Excluding one well intruded by seawater, the similarity of groundwater to sewage, based on multiple indicators, increased with increasing sanitary sewer exfiltration probability (modeled from infrastructure within ca. 300 m of each well). In the absence of direct exfiltration or defect measurements, sewer exfiltration probabilities modeled from the collection system's physical data can indicate potential locations where urban shallow groundwater is contaminated by sewage."

"A tiered, integrated biological and chemical monitoring framework for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic ecosystems",Oct 2015,"The chemical-specific risk-based paradigm that informs monitoring and assessment of environmental contaminants does not apply well to the many thousands of new chemicals that are being introduced into ambient receiving waters. We propose a tiered framework that incorporates bioanalytical screening tools and diagnostic non-targeted chemical analysis to more effectively monitor for contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The framework is based on a comprehensive battery of in vitro bioassays to first screen for a broad spectrum of CECs, and non-targeted analytical methods to identify bioactive contaminants missed by the currently favored targeted analyses. Water quality managers in California have embraced this strategy with plans to further develop and test this framework in regional and statewide pilot studies on waterbodies that receive discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants and stormwater runoff. In addition to directly informing decisions, the data obtained using this framework can be used to construct and validate models that better predict CEC occurrence and toxicity. The adaptive interplay among screening results, diagnostic assessment and predictive modeling will allow managers to make decisions based on the most current and relevant information, instead of extrapolating from parameters with questionable linkage to CEC impacts.

Nano-Structured Magnesium Oxide Coated Iron Ore: Its Application to the Remediation of Wastewater Containing Lead,Sep 2015,"Magnetically separable nano-structured magnesium oxide coated iron ore (IOMgO) was prepared using environmentally benign chemicals, such as iron ore (IO), magnesium(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Mg(NO3)2 · 6H2O] and urea; via an easy and fast preparation method. The IOMgO was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and alternating gradient magnetometer (AGM) analyses. The isotherm and kinetic studies indicated that IOMgO has a comparably higher Langmuir constant (K L , 1.69 L mg−1) and maximum sorption capacity (33.9 mg g−1) for lead (Pb) than other inorganic media. Based on MgO amount, the removal capacity of Pb by IOMgO was 2,724 mg Pb (g MgO)−1, which was higher than that (1,980 mg g−1) for flowerlike magnesium oxide nanostructures reported by Cao et al. The kinetics, FE-SEM, elemental mapping and XRD results revealed that the substitution followed by precipitation was identified as the mechanism of Pb removal and plumbophyllite (Pb2Si4O10 ·H2O) was the precipitated phase of Pb. A leaching test revealed that IOMgO had negligible concentrations of leached Fe at pH 4–9. Since the base material, IO, is cheap and easily available, IOMgO could be produced in massive amounts and used for remediation of wastewater containing heavy metals, applying simple and fast magnetic separation."
On-line sensor monitoring for chemical contaminant attenuation during UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process,Sep 2015,"A combination of surrogate parameters and indicator compounds were measured to predict the removal efficiency of trace organic compounds (TOrCs) using low pressure (LP)-UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process (AOP), engaged with online sensor-based monitoring system. Thirty-nine TOrCs were evaluated in two distinct secondary wastewater effluents in terms of estimated photochemical reactivity, as a function of the rate constants of UV direct photolysis (kUV) and hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation (kOH). The selected eighteen TOrCs were classified into three groups that served as indicator compounds: Group 1 for photo-susceptible TOrCs but with minor degradation by OH oxidation (diclofenac, fluoxetine, iohexol, iopamidol, iopromide, simazine and sulfamethoxazole); Group 2 for TOrCs susceptible to both direct photolysis and OH oxidation (benzotriazole, diphenhydramine, ibuprofen, naproxen and sucralose); and Group 3 for photo-resistant TOrCs showing dominant degradation by OH oxidation (atenolol, carbamazepine, DEET, gemfibrozil, primidone and trimethoprim). The results indicate that TOC (optical-based measurement), UVA254 or UVT254 (UV absorbance or transmittance at 254 nm), and total fluorescence can all be used as suitable on-line organic surrogate parameters to predict the attenuation of TOrCs. Furthermore, the automated real-time monitoring via on-line surrogate sensors and equipped with the developed degradation profiles between sensor response and a group of TOrCs removal can provide a diagnostic tool for process control during advanced treatment of reclaimed waters.

In vitro bioassays to evaluate complex chemical mixtures in recycled water,Sep 2015,"With burgeoning population and diminishing availability of freshwater resources, the world continues to expand the use of alternative water resources for drinking, and the quality of these sources has been a great concern for the public as well as public health professionals. In vitro bioassays are increasingly being used to enable rapid, relatively inexpensive toxicity screening that can be used in conjunction with analytical chemistry data to evaluate water quality and the effectiveness of water treatment. In this study, a comprehensive bioassay battery consisting of 36 bioassays covering 18 biological endpoints was applied to screen the bioactivity of waters of varying qualities with parallel treatments. Samples include wastewater effluent, ultraviolet light (UV) and/or ozone advanced oxidation processed (AOP) recycled water, and infiltrated recycled groundwater. Based on assay sensitivity and detection frequency in the samples, several endpoints were highlighted in the battery, including assays for genotoxicity, mutagenicity, estrogenic activity, glucocorticoid activity, arylhydrocarbon receptor activity, oxidative stress response, and cytotoxicity. Attenuation of bioactivity was found to be dependent on the treatment process and bioassay endpoint. For instance, ozone technology significantly removed oxidative stress activity, while UV based technologies were most efficient for the attenuation of glucocorticoid activity. Chlorination partially attenuated genotoxicity and greatly decreased herbicidal activity, while groundwater infiltration efficiently attenuated most of the evaluated bioactivity with the exception of genotoxicity. In some cases, bioactivity (e.g., mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and arylhydrocarbon receptor) increased following water treatment, indicating that transformation products of water treatment may be a concern. Furthermore, several types of bioassays with the same endpoint were compared in this study, which could help guide the selection of optimized methods in future studies. Overall, this research indicates that a battery of bioassays can be used to support decision-making on the application of advanced water treatment processes for removal of bioactivity.

Point-of-Use Devices for Attenuation of Trace Organic Compounds in Water (In Press),Sep 2015,"Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) continue to be detected in drinking water, and their recalcitrance makes them difficult to attenuate without installing expensive advanced treatment processes. Because human consumption is a small portion of net household water use, point-of-use (POU) devices may provide additional security against drinking water contaminants. This research evaluated three pitcher and two refrigerator POU devices using two waters. Refrigerator POU devices removed more TOrCs over the manufacturer's expected lifetime in terms of total mass than the pitcher POU devices. Average removal through all filters for nonionic, hydrophobic compounds was higher than for hydrophilic compounds in both waters. Removal of ionic compounds was enhanced by cation/anion exchange resins present in pitcher POU devices. Results indicated that POU devices are capable of removing significant amounts of organic contaminants in water. However, removal of a specific compound depends on its molecular properties, treatment technology implemented, and water quality and lifetime of the cartridge. 2015"
Evaluation of the transport Parameters and physiochemical properties of forward osmosis Membranes after treatment of produced water,Sep 2015,"The application of semipermeable membranes for dewatering of complex oil and gas wastewaters continues to be a topic of increasing interest. Several studies have explored the fouling propensity and contaminant rejection of osmotically driven membranes during forward osmosis (FO) treatment of produced waters; however, none have investigated changes in membrane transport and physiochemical properties after exposure to these feed streams. In this study we discuss the impacts of produced water exposure on the transport and active layer surface properties of cellulose triacetate (CTA) and polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) FO membranes. While produced water exposure yields some, albeit minor changes to the membrane performance and surface characteristics of the CTA and the traditional TFC membranes, close to 50% reduction in reverse salt flux and contaminant transport was observed for a surface-modified TFC FO membrane only minimal changes in water permeability were recorded. Results of this study demonstrate the chemical and physical robustness of FO membranes for treatment of oil and gas wastewaters, and they highlight a knowledge gap that exists in membrane polymer selection and contaminant interactions with the membrane polymer matrix that should be further addressed in future membrane fouling studies."
Magnetised nanocomposite mesoporous silica and its application for effective removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution,Aug 2015,"Abstract Via a new synthetic route, magnetized nanocomposite mesoporous material (MNCM) was prepared using silica (SiO2) and nano-magnetite (Fe3O-4). The formation mechanism of MNCM was determined using various spectroscopic analyses. Among the synthesized materials, MNCM–1, prepared with a molecular weight ratio of Fe3O-4 to SiO2 of 0.14:1, had a homogeneous mesopore structure with a mean pore size of 4.68 nm, specific surface area of 576 m2 g-1, and a pore volume of 0.65 cm3 g-1. MNCM-1 had magnetic properties (2.9 emu) and structural strength, as well as higher and faster adsorptive MB removal than other mesoporous materials. The removal of MB by MNCM-1 was found to be a physisorption process with an electrostatic interaction between negatively charged silanol (Si–O-) and positively charged MB, and was thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures. The economic assessment revealed that treatment costs for MB-containing water using MNCM-1 were 16–80 times lower than those with other mesoporous materials, due to the use of the cheap Si precursor and the higher sorption capacity. Furthermore, MNCM-1 can be reused and regenerated without any defects after easy separation using a magnet. Because MNCM-1 can be produced economically on a large scale, it may have significant effects for adsorption-based treatment systems with regard to the removal of MB from waste water."
Modeling approaches to predict removal of trace organic compounds by ozone oxidation in potable reuse applications,Jul 2015,"Realized and potential threats of water scarcity due in part to global climate change have increased the interest in potable reuse of municipal wastewater. Recalcitrant trace organic compounds (TOrCs), including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds in wastewater are often not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Ozone application has been demonstrated to be a highly efficient oxidation process to attenuate TOrCs. However, operation of ozone oxidation can be challenging in wastewater due to variations in water quality that can impact critical control points through fluctuations in ozone demand/decay. Therefore, this study implemented three explanatory modeling techniques including multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neutral network (ANN), and PC (principal component)-ANN to predict TOrCs removal by ozone oxidation in a secondary wastewater effluent. All the developed models displayed good agreements between the predicted TOrCs removal and the observed TOrCs removal with the explanatory variables (input variables) of ozone dose, total organic carbon (TOC) concentration, and rate constants of ozone and ˙OH. PC-ANN displayed the highest predictive power in the external validation step (R2 = 0.934) successively followed by ANN (R2 = 0.914) and MLR (R2 = 0.758). Based on the MLR model equation and the result of sensitivity analysis of the ANN model, TOC was found to have negligible effects on the TOrCs removal in a given water quality. Despite the predictive power of the ANN model, possible overfitting remains to be solved since the cross validation coefficient (q2) value calculated by the leave-one-out cross validation was not sufficient to ensure model predictive power. In contrast, the PC-ANN model was found to be robust across the scenarios applied. This study provides a guideline for software sensors to control ozone treatment processes in regards to TOrC oxidation and likely can be adapted to monitor disinfection as well."
Bioanalytical tools: Half a century of application for potable reuse,Jul 2015,"In vitro bioassays, more recently referred to as ""bioanalytical tools"" in an attempt to emphasize their analytical purpose rather than the uncertain relation to adverse health outcomes, are often thought of as novel tools by water stakeholders. They have, however, been used for over half a century in assessment of recycled water quality. Today, millions of chemicals and formulations are available for commercial use and most have a high propensity to enter sewage collection systems. However, traditional health risk assessment methods involving animal testing at high doses and extrapolation to environmental relevant levels are vastly overwhelmed in capacity by the innumerable chemicals and transformation products potentially present in waters. Beyond the sheer magnitude of chemicals, the interactions of these chemicals as complex mixtures is largely unaddressed in traditional regulatory schemes. Morevover, non-human animal models are often misleading due to differences in metabolism and associated pharmacokinetics. Thus, water professionals continue to struggle with ever increasing numbers of chemicals detected at trace levels in water and the potential interactions of these chemicals during mixture exposures. Bioanalytical tools offer a path forward towards more comprehensive chemical evaluations of water, which can provide greater public confidence in the ability of potable reuse schemes to produce clean and safe drinking water."
Synthesis Mechanism and Thermal Optimization of an Economical Mesoporous Material Using Silica: Implications for the Effective Removal or Delivery of Ibuprofen,Jul 2015,"Mesoporous silica materials (MSMs) were synthesized economically using silica (SiO2) as a precursor via a modified alkaline fusion method. The MSM prepared at 500°C (MSM-500) had the highest surface area, pore size, and volume, and the results of isotherms and the kinetics of ibuprofen (IBP) removal indicated that MSM-500 had the highest sorption capacity and fastest removal speed vs. SBA-15 and zeolite. Compared with commercial granular activated carbon (GAC), MSM-500 had a ~100 times higher sorption rate at neutral pH. IBP uptake by MSM-500 was thermodynamically favorable at room temperature, which was interpreted as indicating relatively weak bonding because the entropy (∆adsS, -0.07 J mol-1 K-1) was much smaller. Five times recycling tests revealed that MSM-500 had 83-87% recovery efficiencies and slower uptake speeds due to slight deformation of the outer pore structure. In the IBP delivery test, MSM-500 drug loading was 41%, higher than the reported value of SBA-15 (31%). The in vitro release of IBP was faster, almost 100%, reaching equilibrium within a few hours, indicating its effective loading and unloading characteristics. A cost analysis study revealed that the MSM was ~10-70 times cheaper than any other mesoporous silica material for the removal or delivery of IBP."
Interlaboratory comparison of in vitro bioassays for screening of endocrine active chemicals in recycled water,Jul 2015,"In vitro bioassays have shown promise as water quality monitoring tools. In this study, four commercially available in vitro bioassays (GeneBLAzer(®) androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor-alpha (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) assays) were adapted to screen for endocrine active chemicals in samples from two recycled water plants. The standardized protocols were used in an interlaboratory comparison exercise to evaluate the reproducibility of in vitro bioassay results. Key performance criteria were successfully achieved, including low background response, standardized calibration parameters and high intra-laboratory precision. Only two datasets were excluded due to poor calibration performance. Good interlaboratory reproducibility was observed for GR bioassay, with 16-26% variability among the laboratories. ER and PR bioactivity was measured near the bioassay limit of detection and showed more variability (21-54%), although interlaboratory agreement remained comparable to that of conventional analytical methods. AR bioassay showed no activity for any of the samples analyzed. Our results indicate that ER, GR and PR, were capable of screening for different water quality, i.e., the highest bioactivity was observed in the plant influent, which also contained the highest concentrations of endocrine active chemicals measured by LC-MS/MS. After advanced treatment (e.g., reverse osmosis), bioactivity and target chemical concentrations were both below limits of detection. Comparison of bioassay and chemical equivalent concentrations revealed that targeted chemicals accounted for ≤5% of bioassay activity, suggesting that detection limits by LC-MS/MS for some chemicals were insufficient and/or other bioactive compounds were present in these samples. Our study demonstrated that in vitro bioassays responses were reproducible, and can provide information to complement conventional analytical methods for a more comprehensive water quality assessment.

Water Reuse in EU-States: Necessity for Uniform Criteria to Mitigate Human and Environmental Risks,Jul 2015,"Water quality criteria are an indispensable part of water recycling projects aiming to ensure the protection of public health and the environment. In addition, criteria can affect the development, public acceptance and the economic viability of water recycling projects. Currently no uniform criteria exist, but they diverge, often greatly, between countries/states. Here we briefly present the evolution of recycling criteria worldwide and discuss emerging issues related to ecological and public health risks that have not addressed adequately in existing criteria. We specifically focus on EU countries and present their water recycling status based on the published data and the existing (or non-existing) recycling frameworks. Data gathered from public agencies reveal a high potential for recycling in the EU that could potentially contribute to ensuring that fresh water is available for all sectors and to protect the environment, but it has not expanded at the expected rates. The lack of water recycling criteria was thought as the most important cause for this delay. In the last decade, however, several countries and particularly these located in the Mediterranean basin, established relevant regulations. Similarities and differences as well as potential benefits and drawbacks of these regulations are discussed and interpreted with these of the other world. Moreover major challenges, the future views, and the necessity for establishing common regulations at an EU level are considered."

Rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS method for analysis of prioritized indicator compounds in wastewater effluent,May 2015,"Trace organic compounds (TOrCs) have been detected in drinking water sources for several years, raising concerns due to their potential risks to public health. The main contributor of TOrCs to drinking water is through wastewater discharges. However, there are several hundred TOrCs currently known with numerous new organic chemicals being released daily, making it unfeasible to monitor each one in water. This study used a detailed literature review and scoring system to establish a list of twenty priority indicator TOrCs in US wastewaters. Next, a rapid direct injection LC-MS/MS method for analysis of these compounds was developed without the need for an extraction step and only 80 µL sample volume while providing method reporting limits of 3-39 ng/L for all but one TOrC (sucralose: 302 ng/L). The elimination of an extraction step reduced matrix effects considerably making the method suitable for wastewater analysis. Method validation including matrix spike recoveries, linearity of calibration curve and inter- and intra-day variability was successfully performed. Finally, the twenty indicator TOrCs were evaluated in four different wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents through four sample campaigns spread across a year. The occurrence data indicated that all indicator TOrCs were detected in at least three out of the four WWTP effluents. Sucralose, iohexol, TCPP, acesulfame and gemfibrozil were detected in all samples at the four WWTPs indicating they could be used as indicators of wastewater influence in receiving waters. DEET, caffeine, triclosan, iopromide and others are effective indicators at showing seasonal variations, treatment process efficacy, and consumption patterns. Overall, the impact of this study will have develop more effective monitoring programs for TOrCs in water reuse schemes."

Investigating landfill leachate as a source of trace organic pollutants,Mar 2015,"Landfill leachate samples (n=11) were collected from five USA municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills and analyzed for ten trace organic pollutants that are commonly detected in surface and municipal wastewater effluents (viz., carbamazepine, DEET, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, PFOA, PFOS, primidone, sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim). Carbamazepine, DEET, PFOA and primidone were detected in all leachate samples analyzed and gemfibrozil was detected in samples from four of the five-landfill sites. The contaminants found in the highest concentrations were DEET (6900-143000ngL(-1)) and sucralose (<10-621000ngL(-1)). Several compounds were not detected (fluoxetine) or detected infrequently (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and PFOS). Using the average mass of DEET in leachate amongst the five landfills and scaling the mass release from the five test landfills to the USA population of landfills, an order of magnitude estimate is that over 10000kg DEETyr(-1) may be released in leachate. Some pharmaceuticals have similar annual mean discharges to one another, with the estimated annual discharge of carbamazepine, gemfibrozil, primidone equating to 53, 151 and 128kgyear(-1). To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that primidone has been included in a landfill leachate study. While the estimates developed in this study are order of magnitude, the values do suggest the need for further research to better quantify the amount of chemicals sent to wastewater treatment facilities with landfill leachate, potential impacts on treatment processes and the significance of landfill leachate as a source of surface water contamination.

Predicting trace organic compound breakthrough in granular activated carbon using fluorescence and UV absorbance as surrogates,Mar 2015,"This study investigated the applicability of bulk organic parameters like dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), and total fluorescence (TF) to act as surrogates in predicting trace organic compound (TOrC) removal by granular activated carbon in water reuse applications. Using rapid small-scale column testing, empirical linear correlations for thirteen TOrCs were determined with DOC, UV254, and TF in four wastewater effluents. Linear correlations (R(2) > 0.7) were obtained for eight TOrCs in each water quality in the UV254 model, while ten TOrCs had R(2) > 0.7 in the TF model. Conversely, DOC was shown to be a poor surrogate for TOrC breakthrough prediction. When the data from all four water qualities was combined, good linear correlations were still obtained with TF having higher R(2) than UV254 especially for TOrCs with log Dow>1. Excellent linear relationship (R(2) > 0.9) between log Dow and the removal of TOrC at 0% surrogate removal (y-intercept) were obtained for the five neutral TOrCs tested in this study. Positively charged TOrCs had enhanced removals due to electrostatic interactions with negatively charged GAC that caused them to deviate from removals that would be expected with their log Dow. Application of the empirical linear correlation models to full-scale samples provided good results for six of seven TOrCs (except meprobamate) tested when comparing predicted TOrC removal by UV254 and TF with actual removals for GAC in all the five samples tested. Surrogate predictions using UV254 and TF provide valuable tools for rapid or on-line monitoring of GAC performance and can result in cost savings by extended GAC run times as compared to using DOC breakthrough to trigger regeneration or replacement.

N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation at an indirect potable reuse facility,Mar 2015,"Full-scale experiments to evaluate N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and attenuation were performed within an advanced indirect potable reuse (IPR) treatment system, which includes, sequentially: chloramination for membrane fouling control, microfiltration (MF), reverse osmosis (RO), ultraviolet irradiation with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2), final chloramination, and pH stabilization. Results of the study demonstrate that while RO does effectively remove the vast majority of NDMA precursors, RO permeate can still contain significant concentrations of NDMA precursors resulting in additional NDMA formation during chloramination. Thus, it is possible for this advanced treatment system to produce water with NDMA levels higher than regional requirements for potable applications (10 ng/L). The presence of H2O2 during UV oxidation reduced NDMA photolysis efficiency and increased NDMA formation (∼22 ng/L) during the secondary chloramination and lime stabilization. This is likely due to formation of UV/H2O2 degradation by-products with higher NDMA formation rate than the parent compounds. However, this effect was diminished with higher UV doses. Bench-scale experiments confirmed an enhanced NDMA formation during chloramination after UV/H2O2 treatment of dimethylformamide, a compound detected in RO permeate and used as model precursor in this study. The effect of pre-ozonation for membrane fouling control on NDMA formation was also evaluated at pilot- (ozone-MF-RO) and bench-scale. Relatively large NDMA formation (117–227 ng/L) occurred through ozone application that was dose dependent, whereas chloramination under typical dosages and contact times of IPR systems resulted in only a relatively small increase of NDMA (∼20 ng/L). Thus, this research shows that NDMA formation within a potable water reuse facility can be challenging and must be carefully evaluated and controlled."

Formation and speciation of haloacetic acids in seawater desalination using chlorine dioxide as disinfectant,Dec 2014,"To evaluate the formation potential of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in a SWRO system when chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is used as a chemical disinfectant, the impact of principle precursors such as natural organic matter (NOM) and bromide ion on haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation and its speciation was investigated. In the presence of high bromide levels found in seawater, the active oxidizing agents formed by the action of ClO2 can react with NOM, resulting in halogenation reactions, and the production of brominated DBPs as the predominant byproducts. Elevating the initial levels of organic substances and bromide ions not only enhanced the total content of HAA5 formed, but also shifted the speciation of HAAs from the chlorinated to fully brominated forms at higher disinfectant doses and longer contact times of ClO2 disinfection. In addition, HAA5 formation potential increased in the order of transphilic > hydrophobic > hydrophilic NOM, suggesting HAA5 yield formed during ClO2 disinfection significantly depends on the characteristics of NOM that can lead to different speciation distribution of DBPs. However, at high doses of ClO2, it was observed that the disinfectant dose plays a more important role in speciation distribution of HAA5 than the characteristics of organic precursors."

Review of National & International Management Approaches for Compounds of Emerging Concerns,Oct 2014,"In the U.S., federal, regional, local, and state regulatory agencies struggle to develop CEC management plans that provide assurance to the public, while balancing often incomplete risk profiles and increasing lists of detected compounds. Several federal programs exist for the management and control of CECs, but the extent and scope or these individual programs and their relative interaction are not widely understood. Outside of the U.S., several countries have proposed or implemented alternative management strategies to the U.S. for CECs in water. Most noticeable are initiatives in the European Union, Switzerland, Germany, Asia, and Australia. This paper summarizes programs for CECs in the U.S., the European Union, and Switzerland. Regulatory and non-regulatory CEC management strategies are discussed and placed in the relevant regulatory, social-political, and topographical context specific to each country."

Environmental Designer Drugs: When Transformation May Not Eliminate Risk,Sep 2014,"Environmental transformation processes, including those occurring in natural and engineered systems, do not necessarily drastically alter molecular structures of bioactive organic contaminants. While the majority of generated transformation products are likely benign, substantial conservation of structure in transformation products can imply conservation or even creation of bioactivity across multiple biological endpoints and thus incomplete mitigation of ecological risk. Therefore, focusing solely on parent compound removal for contaminants of higher relative risk, the most common approach to fate characterization, provides no mechanistic relationship to potential biological effects and is inadequate as a comprehensive metric for reduction of ecological risks. Here, we explore these phenomena for endocrine-active steroid hormones, focusing on examples of conserved bioactivity and related implications for fate assessment, regulatory approaches, and research opportunities."
Costs of Advanced Treatment in Water Reclamation,Sep 2014,"The additional removal of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) provided by advanced water and wastewater treatment inevitably requires additional financial costs, which must be estimated to support utility planning and compare alternatives. This study presents conceptual-level (Class 4) capital and annual operations and maintenance (O&M) cost curve equations to aid evaluations of advanced treatment trains for water reuse. The cost curve equations are broadly applicable to the water reuse community, particularly those interested in ozone-based treatment trains. Unit processes include microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes (MF/UF), nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes (NF/RO), ozone (with or without hydrogen peroxide, H2O2), ultraviolet (UV) treatment with H2O2 (UV/H2O2), and biological activated carbon (BAC); all cost curves are for a unit process and can be added together to obtain costs for a combined treatment train. The cost curves indicate that at all plant capacities (1 to 500 MGD), membrane treatment (e.g., MF or RO) represents the highest cost unit process, ozone the least, and BAC or UV/H2O2 fall in between. Additionally, the relationship between ozone dose and TOrC removal is discussed with a demonstration of how costs change with increasing ozone dose to achieve desired TOrC destruction."

Preparation and characterization of magnetic-core titanium dioxide: Implications for photocatalytic removal of ibuprofen,Aug 2014,"Magnetically separable titanium dioxides (MSTs) were synthesized from nano-magnetite (Fe3O4), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and titanium butoxide (TBT) using a sol-gel process, and their activity in the photocatalytic oxidation of ibuprofen (IBP) was evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) revealed that the thickness of TiO2 layers was linearly dependent on the TBT content, producing predictable results. As the ratio of TBT (mL) to TEOS (mL) increased, the purity of the TiO2 layers of the prepared MSTs increased owing to the absence of Si compounds. Based on TEM-EDS, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, TiO2 in MSTs was successfully coated on the surface of amorphous SiO2 with Fe3O4 as the core. Magnetization of the MSTs declined exponentially with increasing thickness of the non-magnetic SiO2-TiO2 layer. The optimal loading and activation energy of MSTs were also determined for photocatalytic removal of IBP. Comparison of the kinetic constants suggests a positive relationship between photocatalytic activity and surface area. Increased aggregation of the MSTs with higher magnetization values was attributed to stronger magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. The results of this study provide an in-depth understanding of the synthesis of magnetically separable catalysts satisfying the requirements of both magnetic separation and photocatalytic activity with potential application in the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants."

Increased Susceptibility to Methotrexate-Induced Toxicity in Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis,Jul 2014,"Hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters play a crucial role in determining the fate of drugs, and alterations in liver function can place individuals at greater risk for adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We have shown that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) leads to changes in the expression and localization of enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of numerous drugs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of NASH on methotrexate (MTX) disposition and the resulting toxicity profile. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a control or methionine-choline deficient diet for 8 weeks to induce NASH, then administered a single i.p. vehicle, 10, 40, or 100mg/kg MTX injection followed by blood, urine, and feces collection over 96 hours with terminal tissue collection. At the onset of dosing, Abcc1-4, Abcb1, and Abcg2 were elevated in NASH livers, whereas Abcc2 and Abcb1 were not properly localized to the membrane, similar to that previously observed in human NASH. NASH rodents receiving 40-100mg/kg MTX exhibited hepatocellular damage followed by initiation of repair, whereas damage was absent in controls. NASH rodents receiving 100mg/kg MTX exhibited slightly greater renal toxicity, indicating multiple organ toxicity, despite the majority of the dose being excreted by 6 hours. Intestinal toxicity in NASH however, was strikingly less severe than controls, and coincided with reduced fecal MTX excretion. Because MTX-induced gastrointestinal toxicity limits the dose escalation necessary for cancer remission, these data suggest a greater risk for life-threatening MTX-induced hepatic and renal toxicity in NASH in the absence of overt gastrointestinal toxicity."

N-Nitrosodimethylamine Formation upon Ozonation and Identification of Precursors Source in a Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant,Jul 2014,"Ozone doses normalized to the dissolved organic carbon concentration were applied to the primary influent, primary effluent, and secondary effluent of a wastewater treatment plant pro-ducing water destined for potable reuse. Results showed the most N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) production from primary effluent, and the recycle streams entering the primary clarifi-ers were identified as the main source of NDMA precursors. The degradation of aminomethylat-ed polyacrylamide (Mannich) polymer used for sludge treatment was a significant cause of pre-cursor occurrence. A strong correlation between NDMA formation and ammonia concentration was found suggesting an important role of ammonia oxidation on NDMA production. During ozonation tests in DI water using dimethylamine (DMA) as model precursor, the NDMA yield significantly increased in the presence of ammonia and bromide due to the formation of hydrox-ylamine and brominated nitrogenous oxidants. In addition, NDMA formation during ozonation of dimethylformamide (DMF), other model precursor used in this study, occurred only in the presence of ammonia and it was attributable to the oxidation of DMF by hydroxyl radicals. Fil-tered wastewater samples (0.7 µm) produced more NDMA than unfiltered samples suggesting that ozone reacted with dissolved precursors and supporting the hypothesis of polymer degrada-tion. Particularly, total suspended solids content similarly affected NDMA formation and UV absorbance decrease during ozonation due to the different ozone demand created in filtered and unfiltered samples."
Online monitoring of Escherichia coli and Bacillus thuringiensis spore inactivation after advanced oxidation treatment,Jul 2014,"Various studies have shown that advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as UV light in combination with hydrogen peroxide is an efficient process for the removal of a large variety of emerging contaminants including microorganisms. The mechanism of destruction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is the enhanced formation of hydroxyl (·OH) radicals, which have a high oxidation potential. The goal of this study was to utilize in-line advanced oxidation to inactivate microbes, and document the inactivation via an in-line, real-time sensor. Escherichia coli cells and Bacillus thuringiensis spores were exposed to UV/H2O2 treatment in DI water, and the online sensor BioSentry(®) was evaluated for its potential to monitor inactivation in real-time. B. thuringiensis was selected as a non-pathogenic surrogate for B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax and a proven biological weapon. UV radiation and UV/H2O2 exposure resulted in a >6 log10 reduction of the viable culturable counts of E. coli vegetative cells, and a 3 log10 reduction of B. thuringiensis spores. Scanning electron microscopy of the treated samples revealed severe damage on the surface of most E. coli cells, yet there was no significant change observed in the morphology of the B. thuringiensis spores. Following AOP exposure, the BioSentry sensor showed an increase in the categories of unknown, rod and spores counts, but overall, did not correspond well with viable count assays. Data from this study show that advanced oxidation processes effectively inactivate E. coli vegetative cells, but not B. thuringiensis spores, which were more resistant to AOP. Further, the BioSentry in-line sensor was not successful in documenting destruction of the microbial cells in real-time."
Inactivation of MS2 coliphage by UV and hydrogen peroxide: Comparison by cultural and molecular methodologies,Mar 2014,"The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOP) are expected to increase for removal of emerging contaminants and pathogens from drinking water. In this study, the performance of a small community ultraviolet light reactor in combination with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for MS2 coliphage inactivation with two different flow rate conditions of 1 gal/min (gpm) and 2 gpm was evaluated. Following UV radiation, MS2 showed a reduction of 5.3-5.8 log10 when quantified with cultural plaque counts, whereas corresponding quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data showed only a 1.7-2.8 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy number. When H2O2 was added at either 2.5 or 5 ppm with UV at both flow rate conditions, enhanced MS2 inactivation occurred with a more than 7 log10 reduction observed via plaque counts, indicating that all added MS2 had been inactivated, since no plaques were formed after incubation at 37°C for 24 h. In contrast, qPCR only showed a corresponding 3-4 log10 reduction in viral RNA copy number. This research also sheds light on the inactivation of MS2 with ultraviolet light and in the presence of hydroxyl radicals and provides a practical use of qPCR to detect MS2 concentration following advanced oxidation relative to traditional plaque methodology; however qPCR detection overestimates the true number of infective virus."
Field-Scale Monitoring of Pharmaceutical Compounds Applied to Active Golf Courses by Recycled Water,Mar 2014,"The scarcity of potable water in arid and semiarid environments has led to the wider use of recycled water for irrigating agricultural fields, parks, golf courses, and other areas. One concern using recycled water as a source of irrigation has been the presence, fate, and transport of pharmaceutical compounds in water that percolates below the root zone of plants; however, very few multiyear field studies have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature. Here, we assessed compound mass flux of 13 pharmaceuticals in the fairways of four golf courses in the southwestern United States during a 2-yr field study. The sites varied by climate and soil type but were similar regarding turfgrass management. The results showed the presence of at least one pharmaceutical compound in nearly all samples collected, although concentrations were substantially lower after transport through the soil. Percent reduction in compound mass fluxes in drainage water was effectively 100% in 22 of 52 cases, 98 to 100% in 27 of 52 cases, and 73 to 94% in 3 of 52 cases (a case is defined as a specific compound measured at a specific site). Mass fluxes migrating below the root zone were calculated as <250 × 10-3 g ha-1 for all compounds and >100 × 10-3 g ha-1 in only two cases. For cases where the majority of the analyses were reportable, all fluxes were <8.80 × 10-3 g ha-1. Carbamazepine, meprobamate, and sulfamethoxazole were most commonly found in drainage water, representing nearly 80% of all reportable detections. This research demonstrates the potential of turfgrass/soil systems to reduce contaminant loading below the root zone and potentially toward groundwater."
The occurrence and fate of chemicals of emerging concern in coastal urban rivers receiving discharge of treated municipal wastewater effluent,Feb 2014,"To inform future monitoring and assessment of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in coastal urban watersheds, the occurrence and fate of more than 60 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), commercial/household chemicals, current-use pesticides, and hormones were characterized in 2 effluent-dominated rivers in southern California (USA). Water samples were collected during 2 low-flow events at locations above and below the discharge points of water reclamation plants (WRPs) and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Approximately 50% of targeted CECs were detectable at stations downstream from WRPs, compared with <31% and <10% at the reference stations above the WRPs. Concentrations of chlorinated phosphate flame retardants were highest among the CECs tested, with mean total aggregate concentrations of tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) of 3400ng/L and 2400ng/L for the 2 rivers. Maximum in-stream concentrations of pyrethroids (bifenthrin and permethrin), diclofenac, and galaxolide exceeded risk-based thresholds established for monitoring of CECs in effluent-dominated receiving waters. In contrast, maximum concentrations of PPCPs commonly detected in treated wastewater (e.g., acetaminophen, N,N,diethyl-meta-toluamide [DEET], and gemfibrozil) were less than 10% of established thresholds. Attenuation of target CECs was not observed downstream of WRP discharge until dilution by seawater occurred in the tidal zone, partly because of the short hydraulic residence times in these highly channelized systems (<3 d). In addition to confirming CECs for future in-stream monitoring, these results suggest that conservative mass transport is an important boundary condition for assessment of the input, fate, and effects of CECs in estuaries at the bottom of these watersheds.

"Determination of micropollutants in combined sewer overflows and their removal in a wastewater treatment plant (Seoul, South Korea)",Jan 2014,"The present study investigated the occurrence of 29 selected micropollutants such as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in surface waters and wastewaters in Seoul (South Korea) during both dry and wet weather conditions. The study area was selected based on the lack of available information regarding the suspected contamination of rivers/creeks by EDCs and PPCPs in the Seoul region and the presence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which serves approximately 4.1 million inhabitants and has a design capacity of 1,297 × 10(3) m(3)/day. Many target compounds (83 %) were detected in samples collected from wastewater treatment influent/effluent, creek water, and combined sewer overflow (CSO). The total EDC/PPCP concentrations were as follows: WWTP influent (69,903 ng/L) > WWTP effluent (50,175 ng/L) >3 creek samples (16,035-44,446 ng/L) during dry weather, and WWTP influent (53,795 ng/L) > WWTP bypass (38,653 ng/L) >5 creek samples (15,260-29,113 ng/L) >2 CSO samples (11,109-11,498 ng/L) during wet weather. EDCs and PPCPs were found to be present at high daily loads (65.1 and 69.8 kg/day during dry and wet weather, respectively) in the WWTP effluent. Compound removal by the WWTP varied significantly by compound: caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, and propylparaben (>90 %), and acesulfame, DEET, iohexol, iopromide, and iopamidol (<5 %). These findings and literature information support the hypothesis that the efficiency of removal of EDCs and PPCPs is strongly dependent on both removal mechanism (e.g., biodegradation, adsorption to sludge, and oxidation by chlorine) and compound physicochemical properties (e.g., pK a and hydrophobicity)."

"An Adaptive, Comprehensive Monitoring Strategy for Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) in California's Aquatic Ecosystems",Jan 2014,"A scientific advisory panel was convened by the State of California to recommend monitoring for chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic systems that receive discharge of municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and storm water runoff. The panel developed a risk-based, screening framework that considered environmental sources and fate of CECs observed in receiving waters across the State. Using existing occurrence and risk threshold data in water, sediment and biological tissue, the panel applied the framework to identify a priority list of CECs for initial monitoring in three representative receiving water scenarios. The initial screening list of 16 CECs identified by the panel included consumer and commercial chemicals, flame retardants, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and natural hormones. The panel designed an iterative, phased strategy with interpretive guidelines that direct and update management actions commensurate with potential risk identified using the risk-based framework and monitoring data. Due to the ever changing nature of chemical use, technology, and management practices, the panel offered recommendations to improve CEC monitoring, including: development of bioanalytical screening methods whose responses integrate exposure to complex mixtures and that can be linked to higher order effects; development/refinement of models that predict the input, fate and effects of future chemicals; and filling of key data gaps on CEC occurrence and toxicity. Lastly, the panel stressed the need for adaptive management, allowing for future review of, and if warranted, modifications to the strategy to incorporate the latest science available to the water resources community.

"Benchmarking Organic Micropollutants in Wastewater, Recycled Water and Drinking Water with In Vitro Bioassays",Dec 2013,"Thousands of organic micropollutants and their transformation products occur in water. Although often present at low concentrations, individual compounds contribute to mixture effects. Cell-based bioassays that target health-relevant biological endpoints may therefore complement chemical analysis for water quality assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate cell-based bioassays for their suitability to benchmark water quality and to assess efficacy of water treatment processes. The selected bioassays cover relevant steps in the toxicity pathways including induction of xenobiotic metabolism, specific and reactive modes of toxic action, activation of adaptive stress response pathways and system responses. Twenty laboratories applied 103 unique in vitro bioassays to a common set of 10 water samples collected in Australia, including wastewater treatment plant effluent, two types of recycled water (reverse osmosis and ozonation/activated carbon filtration), stormwater, surface water, and drinking water. Sixty-five bioassays (63%) showed positive results in at least one sample, typically in wastewater treatment plant effluent, and only five (5%) were positive in the control (ultrapure water). Each water type had a characteristic bioanalytical profile with particular groups of toxicity pathways either consistently responsive or not responsive across test systems. The most responsive health-relevant endpoints were related to xenobiotic metabolism (pregnane X and aryl hydrocarbon receptors), hormone-mediated modes of action (mainly related to the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and antiandrogen activities), reactive modes of action (genotoxicity) and adaptive stress response pathway (oxidative stress response). This study has demonstrated that selected cell-based bioassays are suitable to benchmark water quality and it is recommended to use a purpose-tailored panel of bioassays for routine monitoring."
Results of an Inter laboratory Comparison of Analytical Methods for Contaminants of Emerging Concern in Water,Dec 2013,"An evaluation of existing analytical methods used to measure contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) was performed through an interlaboratory comparison involving 25 research and commercial laboratories. Fifty-two methods were used in the single-blind study to determine method accuracy and comparability for 22 target compounds, including pharmaceuticals, personal care products and steroid hormones, all at ng/L levels in surface and drinking water. Method biases ranged from <10% to well over 100% in both matrices, suggesting that while some methods are accurate, others can be considerably inaccurate. In addition, the number and degree of outliers identified suggest a high degree of variability may be present between methods currently in use. Three compounds, ciprofloxacin, 4-nonylphenol (NP) and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), were especially difficult to measure accurately. While most compounds had overall false positive rates of ≤5%, bisphenol A, caffeine, NP, OP and triclosan had false positive rates >15%. In addition, some methods reported false positives for 17β-estradiol and 17α-ethynylestradiol in unspiked drinking water and deionized water, respectively, at levels higher than published predicted no-effect concentrations for these compounds in the environment. False negative rates were also generally <5%; however, rates were higher for the steroid hormones and some of the more challenging compounds, such as ciprofloxacin. The elevated false positive/negative rates of some analytes emphasize the susceptibility of many current methods to blank contamination, misinterpretation of background interferences and/or inappropriate setting of detection/quantification levels for analysis at low ng/L levels. The results of both comparisons were collectively assessed to identify parameters that resulted in the best overall method performance. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with the calibration technique of isotope dilution were able to accurately quantify most compounds with an average bias of <10% for both matrices. These findings suggest that this method of analysis is suitable at environmentally relevant levels for most of the compounds studied. This work underscores the need for robust, standardized analytical methods for CECs to improve data quality, increase comparability between studies and help reduce false positive and false negative rates."
"Evaluation of Process Control Alternatives for the Inactivation of Escherichia coli, MS2 Bacteriophage, and Bacillus subtilis Spores during Wastewater Ozonation",Nov 2013,"Dissolved ozone concentration integrated over time (CT) is a reliable indicator of disinfection efficacy in drinking water treatment. However, ozone CT may not be measurable in some wastewater ozone applications. In this study, alternative process control parameters, specifically ozone to total organic carbon (O3:TOC) ratio, differential UV254 absorbance (ΔUV254), and differential total fluorescence (ΔTF), were correlated with the inactivation of Escherichia coli, the bacteriophage MS2, and Bacillus subtilis spores in five secondary wastewater effluents. CT values greater than 9 mg-min/L were generally required for measurable inactivation of B. subtilis spores, and CT values of 1 and 2 mg-min/L consistently achieved greater than 6- and 5-log inactivation of MS2 and E. coli, respectively. The O3:TOC, ΔUV254, and ΔTF correlations for MS2 and B. subtilis were useful for predicting inactivation, while those of E. coli were characterized by greater variability.

Spatial and thematic distribution of research on cyanotoxins,Oct 2013,no abstract provided
Spatial and thematic distribution of research on cyanotoxins,Sep 2013,"a b s t r a c t Cyanobacteria in surface water are well known for their ability to form toxic blooms responsible for animal mortality and human poisoning. Accompanying major progress in science and technology, the state of knowledge of cyanotoxins has dramatically increased over the last two decades. The bibliometric approach applied in this study shows the evolution of research and identifies major gaps to be filled by future work. Although the publication rate has gradually increased from one hundred to three hundred articles per year since the 1990s, half of the literature available focuses on microcystins and another quarter on saxitoxins. Other cyanotoxins such as beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine or cylin-drospermopsin remain vastly disregarded. Moreover, most of the publications deal with toxicity and ecology while other research areas, such as environmental and public health, require additional investigation. The analysis of the literature highlights the main journals for the communication of knowledge on cyanotoxins but also reveals that 90% of the research is originated from only ten countries. These countries are also those with the highest H-index and average number of citation per article. Nonetheless, the ranking of these countries is significantly altered when the amount of publications is normalized based on the population, the number of universities, the national gross domestic product or the government revenue. However, the lower amount of publications from Eastern Europe, Africa and South America could also reflect the lack of monitoring campaigns in these regions. This lack could potentially lead to the underestimation of the prevalence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms and the diversity of toxins worldwide."
The Effects of Solids Retention Time in Full-Scale Activated Sludge Basins on Trace Organic Contaminant Concentrations,Aug 2013,"Although pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are largely unregulated, water resource recovery facilities are increasingly using advanced chemical/physical treatment technologies (e.g., advanced oxidation and reverse osmosis) to remove or destroy these trace organic contaminants (TOrCs). This can both reduce potential adverse human health effects in reuse applications and mitigate environmental effects on aquatic ecosystems. Unfortunately, advanced treatment technologies are typically energy intensive and costly to implement, operate, and maintain. The goal of this study was to determine whether optimization of solids retention time (SRT) provided sufficient benefits to warrant such operational strategies for TOrC mitigation. Specifically, SRTs of 5.5, 6, and 15 days were evaluated to determine the effects on several standard wastewater parameters (e.g., nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia concentrations) and the degradation of TOrCs. The experimental SRTs were operated simultaneously in parallel, full-scale activated sludge basins. The results indicate that it can be beneficial to implement biological process optimization strategies using existing infrastructure while reducing reliance on advanced treatment technologies. This study also identified potential operational issues that might arise in activated sludge systems operating at extended SRTs."
Reverse osmosis (RO) and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) hybrid processes: Model-based scenario study,Aug 2013,"We conducted a scenario study on a promising RO–PRO hybrid system to alleviate water and energy demands. We utilized a previously validated reverse osmosis (RO) process model and modified a model of a pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) process to properly consider the spatial distribution of concentration and velocity based on a mass balance principle. Using the models, we compared four different RO–PRO hybrid configurations based on the water and energy return rate (WERR). Subsequently, the comparison of the water production rate and energy production rate confirmed the results that RO plays a dominant role to determine the WERR value. Hybrid systems that use seawater as a feed water for RO are more energy price sensitive. That is, a decrease in the RO plant size considerably diminishes the WERR values; however, the PRO plant size plays a minor role to determine the WERR value. Research and available literature on RO–PRO hybrid processes are in a relatively early stage; this study is a preliminary step to evaluate further advances in hybrid systems that can eventually alleviate water and energy demands."
State of knowledge and concerns on cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins,Jul 2013,"Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous microorganisms considered as important contributors to the formation of Earth's atmosphere and nitrogen fixation. However, they are also frequently associated with toxic blooms. Indeed, the wide range of hepatotoxins, neurotoxins and dermatotoxins synthesized by these bacteria is a growing environmental and public health concern. This paper provides a state of the art on the occurrence and management of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in surface and drinking water, including economic impacts and research needs. Cyanobacterial blooms usually occur according to a combination of environmental factors e.g., nutrient concentration, water temperature, light intensity, salinity, water movement, stagnation and residence time, as well as several other variables. These environmental variables, in turn, have promoted the evolution and biosynthesis of strain-specific, gene-controlled metabolites (cyanotoxins) that are often harmful to aquatic and terrestrial life, including humans. Cyanotoxins are primarily produced intracellularly during the exponential growth phase. Release of toxins into water can occur during cell death or senescence but can also be due to evolutionary-derived or environmentally-mediated circumstances such as allelopathy or relatively sudden nutrient limitation. Consequently, when cyanobacterial blooms occur in drinking water resources, treatment has to remove both cyanobacteria (avoiding cell lysis and subsequent toxin release) and aqueous cyanotoxins previously released. Cells are usually removed with limited lysis by physical processes such as clarification or membrane filtration. However, aqueous toxins are usually removed by both physical retention, through adsorption on activated carbon or reverse osmosis, and chemical oxidation, through ozonation or chlorination. While the efficient oxidation of the more common cyanotoxins (microcystin, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxin and saxitoxin) has been extensively reported, the chemical and toxicological characterization of their by-products requires further investigation. In addition, future research should also investigate the removal of poorly considered cyanotoxins (β-methylamino-alanine, lyngbyatoxin or aplysiatoxin) as well as the economic impact of blooms."
Ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for rapid analysis of trace organic contaminants in water,Jun 2013,"Background
The widespread utilization of organic compounds in modern society and their dispersion through wastewater have resulted in extensive contamination of source and drinking waters. The vast majority of these compounds are not regulated in wastewater outfalls or in drinking water while trace amounts of certain compounds can impact aquatic wildlife. Hence it is prudent to monitor these contaminants in water sources until sufficient toxicological data relevant to humans becomes available. A method was developed for the analysis of 36 trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) including pharmaceuticals, pesticides, steroid hormones (androgens, progestins, and glucocorticoids), personal care products and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs) using a single solid phase extraction (SPE) technique with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The method was applied to a variety of water matrices to demonstrate method performance and reliability.

Results
UHPLC-MS/MS in both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes was employed to achieve optimum sensitivity while reducing sample analysis time (<20 min) compared with previously published methods. The detection limits for most compounds was lower than 1.0 picogram on the column while reporting limits in water ranged from 0.1 to 15 ng/L based on the extraction of a 1 L sample and concentration to 1 mL. Recoveries in ultrapure water for most compounds were between 90-110%, while recoveries in surface water and wastewater were in the range of 39-121% and 38-141% respectively. The analytical method was successfully applied to analyze samples across several different water matrices including wastewater, groundwater, surface water and drinking water at different stages of the treatment. Among several compounds detected in wastewater, sucralose and TCPP showed the highest concentrations.

Conclusion
The proposed method is sensitive, rapid and robust; hence it can be used to analyze a large variety of trace organic compounds in different water matrixes."
Genomic and phenotypic response of hornyhead turbot exposed to municipal wastewater effluents,May 2013,"Laboratory tests with marine flatfish were conducted to investigate associations among gene expression, higher biological responses and wastewater effluent exposure. In the present study, male hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) were exposed to environmentally realistic (0.5%) and higher (5%) concentrations of chemically enhanced advanced-primary (PL) and full-secondary treated (HTP) effluents from two southern California wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Hepatic gene expression was examined using a custom low-density microarray. Alterations in gene expression (vs. controls) were observed in fish exposed to both effluent types. Fish exposed to 0.5% PL effluent showed changes in genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, steroids, and lipids, among other processes. Fish exposed to 5% PL effluent showed expression changes in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, stress responses, xenobiotic metabolism, and steroid synthesis, among others. Exposure to 5% HTP effluent changed the expression of genes involved in lipid, glutathione and xenobiotic metabolism, as well as immune responses. Although no concentration-dependent patterns of response to effluent exposure were found, significant Spearman correlations were observed between the expression of 22 genes and molecular and/or higher biological responses. These results indicate that microarray gene expression data correspond to higher biological responses and should be incorporated in studies assessing fish health after exposure to complex environmental mixtures."
Prediction of Micropollutant Elimination during Ozonation of Municipal Wastewater Effluents: Use of Kinetic and Water Specific Information,May 2013,"Ozonation is effective in improving the quality of municipal wastewater effluents by eliminating organic micropollutants. Nevertheless, ozone process design is still limited by (i) the large number of structurally-diverse micropollutants and (ii) the varying quality of wastewater matrices (especially dissolved organic matter). These issues were addressed by grouping 16 micropollutants according to their ozone and hydroxyl radical (•OH) rate constants, and normalizing the applied ozone dose to the dissolved organic carbon concentration (i.e., gO3/gDOC). Consistent elimination of micropollutants was observed in 10 secondary municipal wastewater effluents spiked with 16 micropollutants (~2 μg/L) in absence of ozone demand exerted by nitrite. The elimination of ozone-refractory micropollutants was well predicted by measuring the •OH exposure by the decrease of the probe compound para-chlorobenzoic acid. The average molar •OH yields (moles of •OH produced per mole of ozone consumed) were 21±3% for gO3/gDOC = 1.0, and the average rate constant for the reaction of •OH with effluent organic matter was 2.1(±0.6)x104 (mgC/L)-1 s-1. Based on these results, a DOC-normalized ozone dose together with the rate constants for the reaction of the selected micropollutants with ozone and •OH and the measurement of the •OH exposure are proposed as key parameters for the prediction of the elimination efficiency of micropollutant during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents with varying water quality."
Modeling of colloidal fouling in forward osmosis membrane: Effects of reverse draw solution permeation,Apr 2013,"A numerical model for predicting the flux decline due to colloidal fouling was developed for a forward osmosis (FO) membrane system. We derived the kinetic equation of the cake layer growth based on a first-order reaction and control volume approach. Based on the model simulation, it was found that the deposited particles on a membrane surface are proportional to the feed concentration and the permeate flux. Moreover, the simulation result reveals that the cake-enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP) is a key factor diminishing the permeate flux for large colloidal foulants. For small colloidal foulants, the hydraulic resistance of the cake layer is dominant in flux decline at the beginning of the fouling and CEOP increasingly become significant as fouling progresses. The effects of the reverse draw solute permeation on the flux decline were also simulated. Interestingly, the increased reverse draw solute permeation obtained by increasing the solute permeability showed little effect on the flux decline. Contrarily, variation of the diffusivity significantly influenced the flux decline. Consequently, the numerical model developed in this paper suggests that the selection of draw solute for an FO membrane process should be carefully regarded, along with the fouling mechanism."
Association between Water Consumption from Polycarbonate Containers and Bisphenol A Intake during Harsh Environmental Conditions in Summer,Feb 2013,"With the exception of polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles, little attention has been paid to bisphenol A (BPA) intake from packaged water consumption (PC water dispensers), especially during summer weather conditions. We determined the magnitude and variability of urinary BPA concentrations during summer in 35 healthy individuals largely relying upon PC packaged water to satisfy their potable needs. We used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to measure urinary BPA concentrations. A questionnaire was administered in July/August and a spot urine sample was collected on the same day, and seven days after the completion of the interview (without intervention). Linear regression was performed to assess the effect of variables, such as water consumption from different sources on urinary BPA levels using the average of the two urine samples. A significant (p=0.017) positive association was observed between PC water consumption and urinary BPA levels in females only, even after adjusting for covariates in a multivariate regression model. The geometric mean of daily BPA intake back-calculated from urinary BPA data was 118 ng kg bw-1 day-1, nearly double the average intake levels observed in biomonitoring studies, worldwide. Urinary BPA levels were partially ascribed to summer's high PC water consumption and weather characteristics (high temperatures, >40°C, very high UV index values, >8), which could be causing BPA leaching from PC. It is suggested that PC-based water consumption could serve as a proxy to urinary BPA, although the magnitude of its relative contribution to the overall daily intake requires further investigation."
Investigation of the use of Chlorine Based Advanced Oxidation in Surface Water: Oxidation of Natural Organic Matter and Formation of Disinfection Byproducts,Jan 2013,"Disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation during the treatment of raw Colorado River Water (CRW) using aqueous chlorine and ultraviolet (UV) light advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) was investigated. Here, CRW was combined with aqueous chlorine from two distinct sources (electrochemically—generated Mixed Oxidant Solution (MOS) and commercial sodium hypochlorite) and then exposed to ultraviolet C (UV-C) and ultraviolet A (UV-A) light. The impact of the treatment process on the structure of (NOM) in the CRW was examined, as well as the resulting production of various halogenated organic Disinfection By-Products (DBPs). Both AOP conditions tested resulted in destruction of chromophoric components of the NOM, while formation of total amounts of haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes was far below the US EPA regulated maximum contaminant level values for these contaminants, even though the UV and chlorine doses used in these studies were much higher than the typical doses used in an actual treatment process."
Contaminants of emerging concern in municipal wastewater effluents and marine receiving water,Dec 2012,"The occurrence and concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) were investigated in municipal effluents and in marine receiving water. Final effluent from four large publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and seawater collected near the respective POTW outfall discharges and a reference station were collected quarterly over one year and analyzed for 56 CECs. Several CECs were detected in effluents; naproxen, gemfibrozil, atenolol, and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate were the compounds most frequently found and with the highest concentrations (>1 µg/L). Gemfibrozil and naproxen had the highest seawater concentrations (0.0009 and 0.0007 µg/L) and also were among the most frequently detected compounds. Effluent dilution factors ranged from >400 to approximately 1,000. Fewer CECs were detected and at lower concentrations in seawater collected from the reference station than at the outfall sites. Effluent concentrations for some CECs (e.g., pharmaceuticals) were inversely related to the degree of wastewater treatment. This trend was not found in seawater samples. Few temporal differences were observed in effluent or seawater samples. Effluent CEC concentrations were lower than those currently known for chronic toxicity thresholds. Nevertheless, the evaluation of potential chronic effects for CECs is uncertain because aquatic life toxicity thresholds have been developed for only a few CECs, and the effluent and seawater samples had compounds, such as nonylphenol, known to bioaccumulate in local fish. Additional data are needed to better understand the significance of CEC presence and concentrations in marine environments. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. © 2012 SETAC."
Association of drinking-water source and use characteristics with urinary antimony concentrations,Nov 2012,"Environmental factors, such as storage time, frequency of bottle reuse and temperature, have been shown to facilitate antimony (Sb) leaching from water- and food-packaging materials. The globally escalating consumption of water packaged in Sb-containing bottles, such as that of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), could increase human daily Sb doses. This study set out to investigate the relationship between drinking-water source, use characteristics, and urinary Sb concentrations (U-Sb) accompanied with survey responses of a healthy (n=35) Cypriot participant pool. One spot urine sample was collected during administration of questionnaire, while a second spot urine sample was collected from the same individual about 7 days later. Urinary and water Sb concentrations were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Survey responses showed that bottled water summed over various volumes and plastic types, such as polycarbonate and PET contributed to an average 61% of daily water consumption. Water sources such as tap, mobile stations (explained in a following section), and well water contributed to 24%, 14%, and 2% of an individual's daily water consumption pattern, respectively. Average daily potable water use of both bottled and tap water by individuals consisted of 65% drinking-water, while the remaining 35% was water used for preparing cold and hot beverages, such as, tea, coffee, and juices. A significant (P=0.02) association between per capita water consumption from PET bottles and urinary creatinine-unadjusted concentrations was observed, but this relationship did not remain after inclusion of covariates in a multivariate regression model. In the creatinine-adjusted regression model, only gender (female) was a significant (P<0.01) predictor of U-Sb, after adjusting for several covariates. It is proposed that consumption data collection on various water uses and sources among individuals could perhaps decrease the uncertainty associated with derivations of acceptable daily Sb intakes.Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology advance online publication, 28 November 2012; doi:10.1038/jes.2012.104."
Designing monitoring programs for chemicals of emerging concern in potable reuse ⋯ What to include and what not to include?,Nov 2012,"This study discussed a proposed process to prioritize chemicals for reclaimed water monitoring programs, selection of analytical methods required for their quantification, toxicological relevance of chemicals of emerging concern regarding human health, and related issues. Given that thousands of chemicals are potentially present in reclaimed water and that information about those chemicals is rapidly evolving, a transparent, science-based framework was developed to guide prioritization of which compounds of emerging concern (CECs) should be included in reclaimed water monitoring programs. The recommended framework includes four steps: (1) compile environmental concentrations (e.g., measured environmental concentration or MEC) of CECs in the source water for reuse projects; (2) develop a monitoring trigger level (MTL) for each of these compounds (or groups thereof) based on toxicological relevance; (3) compare the environmental concentration (e.g., MEC) to the MTL; CECs with a MEC/MTL ratio greater than 1 should be prioritized for monitoring, compounds with a ratio less than '1' should only be considered if they represent viable treatment process performance indicators; and (4) screen the priority list to ensure that a commercially available robust analytical method is available for that compound."
